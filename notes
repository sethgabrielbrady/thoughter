Learning Objectives

Front end testing requires us to also account for DOM manipulation and Ajax calls.
This assignment will give us some practice writing asynchronous tests and ones
that require a specific piece of HTML to execute. By the end of this assignment
you should understand the basics of setting up an HTML fixture for a test and
using a fake server for Ajax testing.

Your Mission

You have been given a project with some existing code. Fork and then clone the
 project to get started. You will need to set up the testing infrastructure,
 then start writing tests for the two functions:

Read the function doc blocks to get a sense for what is going on
Write a couple sanity check tests
Use fixtures to test the showRecent function
Where should you create the fixture?
Use a fake server to test the getRecent function
Should these tests be in the same describe block as the other function's tests?
Where should the fake server setup go?
You should have at least one test for each function in the source file, and you
must use a fixture and a fake server.



clone repo
node modules
add package.json
add dependencies - mocha, chai, karma
setup .conf.js file
setup spec.js
update readme

TESTING
    UNIT-Jordan believes is most important: testing the smallest unit possible
    E2E-end to end, user machine to bottom layer of the server
    SMOKE- the idea that things generally do what you expect at a high level
    INTEGRATION- just testing the integration between a modules
    USER ACCEPTANCE- from the end user POV, is something acceptable or usable



When unit testing, a function is the smallest unit.
    What is most important is that function does what it is supposed to do.


  TEST- ensures the function does what it is supposed to.
      -ASSERTIONS/expectations.
        Inside the test, we will assert what the outcome should be
        -every test should have assertions





ASSERTIONS for a test for a function  that will sum two numbers:
  is the result a num?
  is there a sum?
  -test for two strings
    -what if the function receives two numbers a strings
  -what if the fn gets no arguments?
  -what if the test only gets 1 arg?

  TESTS collected to test a function might be called a describe block

  a collection of describe block tests might be called a Suite of Tests

  TOOL USED FOR TESTING
  -mocha: a TESTING library-allows for the individual tests-describe block
  -chai: intended to be used with mocha. will provide ASSERTIONS
  -karma: a TEST RUNNER.  Will provide structure for running the tests

  package.json will track the dependencies. will use NPM install

  npm init - gives us the package.json
    -name the init
    -name the entry point (the focal point of the program...usually the main.js)


  to install a dependency and track it, we need to "save" it with --save-dev
      -this saves it in the developer library

  to integrate karma into mocha, chai, and chrome

  karma-mocha
  karma-chai
  karma-chrome-launcher



  for creating a test file, name it the source name .spec.js
          ie (scriptname.spec.js)-this will be in your
            specs subfolder


BDD- behavior driven development
TDD - test driven development
      - these are the same thing

when testing, karma with run the code and create the html...but need to config
    karma 1st

    create a name.conf.js file-
    type modules.exports= function FNNAME (config)
    then we need to config.set({});
        with frameworks:['mocha', 'chai']


GLOBBING PATTERN -  will use an * to look at ALL files

src/* looks for any file in the source
src/**/*.js looks for any file beyond the source file


to run KARMA - we need to type "./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start filename.conf.js"
    this says run it


    Go to chaijs.com for more assertions
        -we want bdd

Tests don't really need docblocks


package.json can be config to run the tests driectly
  by changing the scripts

  "scripts": {
    "test": "karma start math.conf.js"

    then "npm test"



we need to fork and clone the project
    update the readme


1st test ex) expect(1).to.be.equal(1);





Write tests for the two functions in the window.calc namespace...
The description of the functions are in the source code, read them!
Ensure that you are testing not just the success conditions,
but also the failures! For example, ensure that a function acts as
expected both with good arguments and bad arguments!

let result = chai.expect //basically just a shortening of chai expect


// describe just contains the group of assertions


describe('math tests', function() { //describe block

    describe('sum function', function() { //describe block


  //'it' is the test
    it('should return a number when an argument is passed', function() {
        let result = window.calc.sum([1, 1, 1]); //sets 'result' to the
        //to the result of the sum function that has been passed an array
        expect(result).to.be.a('number');//assertion that says what argument type is
        expect(result).to.equal(3);//assertion
    });


will need to do console.info inside of karma




HOMEWORK REVIEW NOTES

***********************
fetch !== XHR

descriptions should be very descriptive for the it('should')

It will help to make a flow chart of the code so that you know
what tests to run.


GET DATA FUNCTION

--
err -- mocha uses this to pass an actual error message

'fetch-mock' is  a tool to emulate a fetch server.
npm install --save-dev fetch-mock
get the notes from class


tot return a promise that rejects, return Promise.reject('message';)
