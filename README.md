## Process Automation
  03/17/17
Let's get some practice setting up process automation using Grunt for an existing project. By the end of this assignment you should have a better understanding of how to add tasks to Grunt and get a basic configuration setup and running.

Start with the project we were working on yesterday (your fork of it anyway). There is a branch in there called phase-two. This branch includes some additional work that your developers have done. We need to take this new code and write some process automation using Grunt to wrangle all of these different tasks.





## Definitely not a Twitter clone. ;-)

Front end testing requires us to also account for DOM manipulation and Ajax calls. This assignment will give us some practice writing asynchronous tests and ones that require a specific piece of HTML to execute. By the end of this assignment
you should understand the basics of setting up an HTML fixture for a test and using a fake server for Ajax testing.

You have been given a project with some existing code. Fork and then clone the project to get started. You will need to set up the testing infrastructure, then start writing tests for the two functions:

More practice with testing with Mocha, Karma, and Chai. This lesson uses Sinon and beforeEach, afterEach, DOM manipulation.
