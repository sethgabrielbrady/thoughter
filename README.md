## Process Automation
### 03/17/17

Let's get some practice setting up ```process automation``` using ```Grunt``` for an existing project. By the end of this assignment you should have a better understanding of how to add tasks to ```Grunt```  and get a ```basic configuration``` setup and running.

Start with your fork of the ```Thoughter``` project. There is a branch in there called ```phase-two```. This branch includes some additional work that your developers have done. We need to take this new code and write some ```process automation``` using ```Grunt``` to wrangle all of these different tasks.

TODO
1. add ```grunt``` to our previous homework
2. change into the ```phase two``` branch
3. after grunt is installed: ```install dependencies```.
4. produce a build, excluding tests and config. Just ```html```, ```css```, and needed ```javascript``` files
5. run ```http-server``` from the build and make sure there are no errors
6. merge phase-two branch back into the ```master```


UPDATE -
added ```grunt-contrib-watch``` plugin. Everything tested and working.

Front end testing requires us to also account for ```DOM manipulation``` and ```Ajax``` calls. This assignment will give us some practice writing ```asynchronous tests``` and ones that require a specific piece of ```HTML``` to execute. By the end of this assignment you should understand the basics of setting up an ```HTML fixture``` for a test and using a ``fake server`` for ```Ajax``` testing.

You have been given a project with some existing code. Fork and then clone the project to get started. You will need to set up the ```testing infrastructure```, then start writing ```tests``` for the two functions:

More practice with testing with``` Mocha```, ```Karma```, and ```Chai```. This lesson uses ```Sinon``` and ```beforeEach```, ```afterEach```, ```DOM manipulation```.
